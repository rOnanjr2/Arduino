/*
test program for the CSDisplayDriver library written by William Fleete
used with CS1694 LED driver chips found in some cheap dvd players. this sketch works with my particular board with
3 push buttons, six 7 segments and 9 other icon lamps. This library will be a WIP and I am a bit green with these
first library I have written to some degree

uses the 3 buttons on my board to change digits and scroll through the segment data for numbers and letters
